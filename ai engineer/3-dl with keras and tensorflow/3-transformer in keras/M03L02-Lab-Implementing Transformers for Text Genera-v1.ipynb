You have successfully built and trained a Transformer model for text generation in this lab using TensorFlow and Keras. You learned how to preprocess text data, create input and target sequences, define the Transformer model architecture, train the model, and generate text using the trained model. By completing this lab, you gained hands-on experience with Transformers for text generation and explored practical applications of this robust model architecture. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"40f55751-f238-40cd-a8cd-95249c981046","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["Copyright © IBM Corporation.
